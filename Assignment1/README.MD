ðŸ—½	Assignment 1  ðŸ—½	
In this assignment, you will first learn how to use PyTorch on Google Colab environment. Then, you will practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

Develop proficiency with PyTorch tensors
Gain experience using notebooks on Google Colab
Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier

ðŸ‘® Q1: PyTorch 101 (50 points)
The notebook pytorch101.ipynb will walk you through the basics of working with tensors in PyTorch.

ðŸ‘® Q2: k-Nearest Neighbor classifier (50 points) 
The notebook kNN.ipynb will walk you through implementing a kNN classifier.
